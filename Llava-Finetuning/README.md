## Fine-Tuning with DeepSpeed

The notebook [llava-finetune.ipynb](https://github.com/brevdev/notebooks/blob/main/llava-finetune.ipynb) demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLaVA model using DeepSpeed. DeepSpeed enables efficient distributed training, reducing time and resource consumption.

### Key Steps:
1. **Environment Setup**: Install necessary packages and configure DeepSpeed.
2. **Model Loading**: Load the pre-trained LLaVA model and tokenizer.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Configure paths and parameters, and initiate fine-tuning with DeepSpeed.
4. **Integration**: Merge LoRA weights with the model for enhanced contextual understanding.

## Custom Dataset Fine-Tuning

Fine-tuning LLaVA on a custom dataset involves adapting the model to specific data requirements. This process is detailed in the resources from [WandB](https://wandb.ai/byyoung3/ml-news/reports/How-to-Fine-Tune-LLaVA-on-a-Custom-Dataset--Vmlldzo2NjUwNTc1) and [Medium](https://medium.com/ubiai-nlp/how-to-fine-tune-llava-on-your-custom-dataset-aca118a90bc3).

### Steps:
1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset that aligns with your task requirements.
2. **Data Annotation**: Use tools like UBIAI for precise labeling and extraction.
3. **Fine-Tuning**: Follow the guide to adjust parameters and train the model on your dataset.

## Data Annotation and Preparation

Accurate data annotation is crucial for effective fine-tuning. UBIAI offers advanced OCR capabilities for extracting information from images, ensuring high-quality labeled data.

### Data Structure:
- Use tags like "QUESTION" and "ANSWER" for form understanding.
- Ensure the data aligns with the model's input requirements.

## Environment Setup

1. **Install Required Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install transformers deepspeed ubiai
   ```
2. Configure Environment: Set up paths for data and model checkpoints.

## Model Evaluation
After fine-tuning, evaluate the model's performance using a specific task or dataset. Configure evaluation parameters and assess metrics like accuracy and precision.

## Conclusion
The integration of language and vision in models like LLaVA represents a significant advancement in AI. Fine-tuning enhances adaptability, allowing the model to excel across various tasks. This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the fine-tuning process, encouraging experimentation and innovation in multimodal AI.
